## Project Description

SciSummarize is a web application designed for automatic summarization of scientific and academic texts. The tool uses artificial intelligence (SciBert model) to analyze PDF documents and generate concise summaries that preserve key information from the original text.

### Key Features

- Automatic summarization of academic texts in any language
- Preservation of key elements: methodology, results, conclusions, and statistical data
- Editing and formatting capabilities for generated summaries
- Export of summaries to PDF format
- Simple user account system

### Target Users

SciSummarize is primarily aimed at students, researchers, and scientists who need quick access to the most important information contained in scientific publications without having to read entire documents.

### Problem Solved

Reading entire scientific texts and academic documents is time-consuming. Many users only need the most important information contained in these materials, such as research methodology, key results, main conclusions, statistical data, and citations.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **HTMX**: Provides interface interactivity without JavaScript framework complexity
- **Jinja2**: Handles server-side HTML template rendering
- **TailwindCSS**: Facilitates UI styling through ready-made CSS classes

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Fast Python API framework with asynchronous support and automatic documentation
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing:
  - User accounts
  - Document metadata
  - Summaries and feedback
- **PyMuPDF**: Efficient library for processing and extracting text from PDF files
- **SciBert**: Specialized AI model for summarizing scientific texts

### CI/CD and Deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automation of testing and deployment processes

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scisummarize.git
cd scisummarize
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables
```bash
# Create .env file with the following variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/scisummarize
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

5. Set up the database
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

6. Run the application
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

7. Access the application
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Available Scripts

- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` - Run the development server with hot reload
- `pytest` - Run tests
- `pytest --cov=app` - Run tests with coverage report
- `python scripts/init_db.py` - Initialize the database
- `python scripts/clean_documents.py` - Run cleanup task for documents older than 24 hours

## Project Scope

### MVP Includes
- PDF document upload (max 10MB)
- AI-powered text summarization
- Summary editing and formatting
- Export to PDF
- User account system
- Binary feedback system (accept/reject)

### Not Included in MVP
- Import of formats other than PDF (DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Sharing texts and summaries between users
- Mobile applications (web application only)
- Processing of scanned documents (OCR)
- System learning from user feedback
- Document categorization or tagging
- Summary versioning
- Selection of specific document parts for summarization
- Advanced security features
- Search in stored documents and summaries
- Adding custom notes to summaries

### Technical Limitations
- Simple web application written in Python
- No support for scanned documents (digital text only)
- No advanced security features at the MVP level
- No system learning from user feedback

## Project Status

Currently in MVP development phase. The core functionality is being implemented according to the requirements specified in the PRD.
